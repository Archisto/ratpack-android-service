# Nappipeli Ratpack API

This is the backend for Nappipeli and handles keeping track of one number, the last 10 prizes won and the winners' nicknames.

This was based on a demo application intended for use with Joe Kutner's blog post on [Using Database-backed RESTful Services on Heroku with Android](http://jkutner.github.io/2016/08/19/android-database-rest-service.html).
